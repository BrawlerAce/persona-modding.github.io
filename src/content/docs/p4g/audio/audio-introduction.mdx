## Format and Location

Persona 4 Golden (PC) generally stores its audio as unecrypted [HCA](https://amicitia.miraheze.org/wiki/HCA) files packed inside [AWB](https://amicitia.miraheze.org/wiki/AWB) file. AWB files are sometimes accompanied by a corresponding [ACB](https://amicitia.miraheze.org/wiki/ACB) file. For the purposes of audio modding, you will generally only care about the AWB file.

Audio is stored in the following locations:

- Music, event SFX, ambience, etc.: `data.cpk/sound/adx2/bgm/snd00_bgm.awb`
  - English specific audio is stored in `data.cpk/sound/adx2/bgm_en/snd00_bgm.awb`
  - P4G's TV listing audio (interviews, hidden Teddie audio) is also stored in this file.
- Event voice lines:
  - Japanese: `data.cpk/sound/adx2/v...`
  - English: `data.cpk/sound/adx2/en/v...`
- Event generic voice lines:
  - Japanese: `data.cpk/sound/adx2/commu.awb`
  - English: `data.cpk/sound/adx2/en/commu.awb`
- Navi voice lines:
  - Japanese: `data.cpk/sound/adx2/btlhlp_k` (Teddie), `data.cpk/sound/adx2/btlhlp_r` (Rise)
  - English: `data.cpk/sound/adx2/en/btlhlp_k` (Teddie), `data.cpk/sound/adx2/en/btlhlp_r` (Rise)
- Battle SFX: `data.cpk/sound/adx2/comse/snd04_comse.awb`
- Battle voice lines:
  - Japanese: `data.cpk/sound/adx2/btlmem.awb`
  - English: `data.cpk/sound/adx2/en/btlmem.awb`
- Battle grunts: stored within model PAK files
  - Japanese: `data.cpk/model/pack/<model>.pac/<model archive>.se/<model archive>.acb`
  - English: `data.cpk/model/pack/<model>.pac/<model archive>.se/<model archive>_e.acb`
  - Many of the character model files are documented [here](https://amicitia.miraheze.org/wiki/Persona_4_Golden/data.cpk/model/pack/Characters).

### foobar2000

[foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/download) with the [vgmstream plugin](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_input_vgmstream) is the recommended tool for opening P4G's audio files. It can directly open AWB and HCA files.

Additionally, audio within archives can be converted to common audio formats such as WAV by right clicking and selecting **Convert**.
