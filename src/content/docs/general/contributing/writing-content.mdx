import {Aside} from "@astrojs/starlight/components"; 

Just read the [Starlight Docs](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/) :)

For special characters, use their [HTML character references](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Character_reference)

<Aside type="danger">
TODO - Actually write some stuff here. It's fine to reference th starlight docs (probably a good idea) but give some specific guidance.

Give some guidelines on how the docs should be written and stuff maybe
