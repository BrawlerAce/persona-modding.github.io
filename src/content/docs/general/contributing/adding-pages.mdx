import {FileTree, Aside} from "@astrojs/starlight/components";


All pages on this site are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files organised under the `src/content/docs` directory.
These are grouped into games such as `p4g` and categories for each game such as `audio`.

<Aside>
    The sidebar in this site is handled by the [Starlight Sidebar Topics](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/) plugin. 
    
    Whilst this page should give you enough information to make most changes you can check out the plugin's [documentation](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/configuration/) for more details.

## Adding a Page
To add a page to an existing category you first need to create an `mdx` file with an appropriate name to the correct directory.

For example, to add a page about event music to the Audio category of P4G you would add a file like `event-music.mdx` to the `src/content/docs/p4g/audio` directory.

<FileTree>
- src
    - content
        - docs
            - p4g
                - audio
                    - audio-addition.mdx
                    - audio-creation.mdx
                    - **event-music.mdx**
                    - ...
</FileTree>

In this file you need to add some frontmatter to get started. This is metadata that is wrapped inside of two sets of `---`s and uses the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format.
You should always set at least the `title`, `description`, and `sidebar.order` in a page's frontmatter. 

For example, for the event music page this may look like

```mdx
---
title: Event Music
description: Learn how to edit event music in Persona 4 Golden (PC).
sidebar:
    order: 3
---
```

These properties mean:
- `title` - The title of the page and the name of the link in the sidebar
- `description` - A description that is shown in the embed when someone links to this page
- `sidebar.order` - The order that this page is shown at in the sidebar. Pages are sorted alphabetically if this is not set (not what we want!)

Two other properties that you might find useful are `prev` and `next`. By setting these to `false` you can hide the next or previous buttons that display at the bottom of the page. This is useful in cases where these end up linking to a page that is in a completely different category (which we don't want).

<Aside>
Whilst these few properties are all you should typically need to set, you can check out Starlight's [Frontmatter Reference](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/) for a full list of valid properties if you're interested.

With the frontmatter for your page set up you should now see it in the live preview of the website. 
Check out the [Writing Content](/general/contributing/writing-content) page to learn how to actually add stuff to it.

## Adding a Page Group

To add a new page group to the sidebar you need to update the  `starlightSidebarTopics` config in the `astro.config.mjs` file at the root directory of the repo.

For example, to add a Reverse Engineering category to P4G you would update the conifg like

```js ins={13-18}
starlightSidebarTopics([
    {
    label: "Persona 4 Golden (PC)",
    link: "/p4g",
    items: [
        "p4g",
        {
            label: "Audio Modding",
            autogenerate: {
                directory: "p4g/audio/",
            },
        },
        {
            label: "Reverse Engineering",
            autogenerate: {
                directory: "p4g/reverse-engineering/",
            },
        },
    ],
    },
]),
```

The properties that you're using are:

- `label` - The label displayed in the sidebar for this group
- `autogenerate.directory` - The directory (under `src/content/docs`) that all of the files for this group will be put in

Then to add pages to your category you would make `mdx` files in `src/content/docs/p4g/reverse-engineering` as described in [Adding a Page](#adding-a-page).

## Adding a Page Sub-Group
Adding a sub-group is similar to adding a full group. The setting for the parent group needs to be updated to use an `items` array instead of the `autogenerate` property. From there, you put a group object in the `items` array for each sub-group.

For example, if the Reverse Engineering category needs to be split up into Beginner and Advanced sub-groups it would be updated like

```js del={15-17} ins={18-31}
starlightSidebarTopics([
    {
    label: "Persona 4 Golden (PC)",
    link: "/p4g",
    items: [
        "p4g",
        {
            label: "Audio Modding",
            autogenerate: {
                directory: "p4g/audio/",
            },
        },
        {
            label: "Reverse Engineering",
            autogenerate: {
                directory: "p4g/reverse-engineering/",
            },
            items: [
                {
                    label: "Beginner",
                    autogenerate: {
                        directory: "p4g/reverse-engineering/beginner"
                    }
                },
                {
                    label: "Advanced",
                    autogenerate: {
                        directory: "p4g/reverse-engineering/advanced"
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
    ],
    },
]),
```

## Adding a Game
To add a new game to the dropdown menu you need to update the `starlightSidebarTopics` configuration in the `astro.config.mjs` file at the root of this repo. This process is similar to adding new page grous/sub-groups.

For example, to add Persona Q you would update the config like
```js ins={12-22}
starlightSidebarTopics([
    {
        label: "General",
        link: "/general/contributing",
        items: [
            {
            label: "Contributing",
            autogenerate: { directory: "/general/contributing" },
            },
        ],
    },
    {
        label: "Persona Q",
        link: "/pq",
        items: [
            "pq"
            {
                label: "Getting Started",
                autogenerate: { directory: "/pq/getting-started" },
            },
        ],
    },
]),
```

The properties used are:

- `label` - The label displayed in the dropdown menu of games
- `link` - The link that you are taken to when clicking on the game from the dropdown (like a home page for the game)
- `items` - The list of items to show in the sidebar for the game

The first item in the `items` array is just the string `pq` as this is just a single page (the home page pointed to by the `link: "/pq"` property), not a category. 
Other than this home page you will generally want to group pages into categories, such as the Getting Started category.

With the sidbear config updated you can then go and create all of your pages. Here the root has been defined as `/pq` by the `link` property so all of the pages for Persona Q will go under `src/content/docs/pq`. For example, you would end up with files looking like:

<FileTree>
- src
    - content
        - docs
            - pq
                - **index.mdx** The home page
                - getting-started
                    - setup.mdx
                    - troubleshooting.mdx
</FileTree>

Note that the `index.mdx` file at the root of `pq` is the home page, what you get to when you click on the game in the dropdown. Other than that, everything else is fairly standard.
